[N01] There's no refund for the bidder when tryAvertChallenge() is true. The bidder could be providing more  _bidAmountZCHF than the necessary to buy the collateral from the challenger.

[N02] Unused function  isChallengeOpen() in mintingHub L239

[N03] Sometimes IERC20(zchf) is used and sometimes zchf is treated directly as an ERC20. The variable zchf is an ERC20 so no need to use IERC20(zchf) and it is better to use the same pattern for better code consistency. 
some examples: 
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-frankencoin/blob/1022cb106919fba963a89205d3b90bf62543f68f/contracts/MintingHub.sol#L263

[N04] It is easier to read 1_000_000 to refer to 1 million than 1000_000. Use 1_000_000.
example: 
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-frankencoin/blob/1022cb106919fba963a89205d3b90bf62543f68f/contracts/MintingHub.sol#L265

[N05] using "is" as a prefix for a function is normally used for functions that return a bool.
Like for example IsMinter(), https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-frankencoin/blob/1022cb106919fba963a89205d3b90bf62543f68f/contracts/Frankencoin.sol#L293
But isPosition() returns an address, https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-frankencoin/blob/1022cb106919fba963a89205d3b90bf62543f68f/contracts/Frankencoin.sol#L300
It is a little confusing how the output of the function should be handled. 

[N06] Using transfer and transferFrom erc20 functions more than a security risk as mentioned in the automated findings, are a restriction for the protocol. This is because, if the system is effective, qualified pool shareholders will veto positions that use, for example, USDT as collateral and no assets will be at risk. The problem is that Frankencoin has no good interest rates for liquidations, so one would typically expect positions to be opened with stablecoins. Restricting the protocol from using one of the biggest stablecoins in the market is not very efficient.
