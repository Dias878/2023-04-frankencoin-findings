Despite on the fact that minters are trusted in the protocol, there can be multiple situations where it will be nessesary to get rid from one of them. However no functions were made for that case. 

What if any minter will watn to hrm the protocol? He can wait to be accepted and then spam with postions, deny new minters, deny new positions or smth like that. 

It is a good practice to have a governor functionality to manage trusted users: cancel their rights, postone or transfer.
