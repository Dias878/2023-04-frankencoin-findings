## [NC-01] Event is missing `indexed` fields.
_Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so itâ€™s not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (threefields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed._

Note: Using the `indexed` keyword for value types such as `uint`, `bool`, and `address` saves gas costs. However, this is only the case for value types, whereas indexing `bytes` and `strings` are more expensive than their unindexed version.
