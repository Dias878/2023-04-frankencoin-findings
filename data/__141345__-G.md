## use enumerable set to reduce complexity to O(N)

Currently the `votes()` function uses nested for loop to check for duplicate in `helper[]`, with O(N^2) complexity. However, OZ enumerable set lib can be used to reduce the complexity to O(N) for the entire function and O(1) for the inner check in line 196-198.

```solidity
File: contracts/Equity.sol
190:     function votes(address sender, address[] calldata helpers) public view returns (uint256) {
191:         uint256 _votes = votes(sender);
192:         for (uint i=0; i<helpers.length; i++){
193:             address current = helpers[i];
194:             require(current != sender);
195:             require(canVoteFor(sender, current));
196:             for (uint j=i+1; j<helpers.length; j++){
197:                 require(current != helpers[j]); // ensure helper unique
198:             }
199:             _votes += votes(current);
200:         }
201:         return _votes;
202:     }
```


## `_transfer()` can be moved after if block

If the allowance is not enough, the whole function will revert. Hence the `_transfer()` can be moved to the end, in case the allowance is not enough, the gas used for `_transfer()` can be saved.

```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20.sol
125:     function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external override returns (bool) {
126:         _transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
127:         uint256 currentAllowance = allowanceInternal(sender, msg.sender);
128:         if (currentAllowance < INFINITY){
129:             // Only decrease the allowance if it was not set to 'infinite'
130:             // Documented in /doc/infiniteallowance.md
131:             if (currentAllowance < amount) revert ERC20InsufficientAllowance(sender, currentAllowance, amount);
132:             _approve(sender, msg.sender, currentAllowance - amount);
133:         }
134:         return true;
135:     }
```
