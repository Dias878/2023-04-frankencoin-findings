## Inadequate calculateFreedAmount()
Users will have to separately figure out on their own what exact `amountExcludingReserve` is needed in order to fully repay their loans when [`currentReserve < minterReserve_`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-frankencoin/blob/main/contracts/Frankencoin.sol#L238). Consider refactoring `calculateFreedAmount()` that will take in another parameter, i.e. the intended [`freedAmount`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-frankencoin/blob/main/contracts/Frankencoin.sol#L252) and correspondingly returns an additional variable, i.e, the required `_amountExcludingReserve`.
