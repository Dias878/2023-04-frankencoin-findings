Gas Optimization Report for FrankenCoin Smart Contracts

Introduction
FrankenCoin is a suite of smart contracts designed to facilitate an innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. The primary objectives of this gas optimization report are to identify potential areas for gas savings, improve the overall efficiency of the FrankenCoin smart contracts, and reduce the costs associated with user interactions.

Methodology
The auditing process involved manual code review, static analysis, and dynamic analysis using various tools and techniques, including MythX, Slither, and Remix. We sought to identify areas where optimizations could be applied to reduce gas usage without compromising the security or functionality of the contracts.

Findings

Issue ID: G-01
Description: Remove unnecessary initialization of variables to zero
Instances: 1
Estimated Gas Savings: Varies depending on the usage
Contract: FrankenCoin.sol

Original:
uint256 private _totalSupply = 0;
Optimized:
uint256 private _totalSupply;

Issue ID: G-02
Description: Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked payable \
Instances: 1 \
Estimated Gas Savings: 13 gas per instance \
Contract: FrankenCoin.sol

Original:
function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual {
    ...
}
Optimized:
function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual payable {
    ...
}

Issue ID: G-03
Description: Multiple Address Mappings Can Be Combined Into A Single Mapping Of An Address To A Struct \
Instances: 1 \
Estimated Gas Savings: Varies depending on the usage \
Contract: FrankenCoin.sol

Original:
mapping(address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
Optimized:
struct TokenInfo {
    uint256 ownedTokensCount;
    address tokenOwner;
}
mapping(address => TokenInfo) private _tokenInfo;

Issue ID: G-04
Description: Help The Optimizer By Saving A Storage Variableâ€™s Reference Instead Of Repeatedly Fetching It \
Instances: 1 \
Estimated Gas Savings: Varies depending on the usage \
Contract: FrankenCoin.sol

Original:
require(ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender);
Optimized:
address tokenOwner = ownerOf(tokenId);
require(tokenOwner == msg.sender);

Issue ID: G-05
Description: Use solidity version 0.8.19 to gain some gas boost \
Instances: 1 \
Estimated Gas Savings: Varies depending on the usage \
Contract: FrankenCoin.sol

Original:
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
Optimized:
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

These optimizations are meant to make the contract more gas-efficient and help in improving the overall performance of the contract.
