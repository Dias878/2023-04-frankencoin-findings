## Findings

### 1- Use `memory` pointers instead of `storage` :

Copying structs from `storage` to `memory` is cheaper as soon as there are more reads on the `storage` pointer as there are properties in the struct.

```


### 2- `storage` variable should be cached into `memory` variables instead of re-reading them :

The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function, the caching of a state variable replaces each Gwarmaccess (100 gas) with a much cheaper stack read, thus saves **100gas** for each instance.

### 3- Multiple address/IDs mappings can be combined into a single mapping of an address/id to a struct :

Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save ~42 gas per access due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

```solidity
83:     mapping (address => address) public delegates;
88:     mapping (address => uint64) private voteAnchor; 
```


### 4- Use `unchecked` blocks to save gas :

Solidity version 0.8+ comes with implicit overflow and underflow checks on unsigned integers. When an overflow or an underflow isnâ€™t possible (as an example, when a comparison is made before the arithmetic operation), some gas can be saved by using an unchecked block.

_balances[sender] -= amount;
```

In the code linked above the operation cannot underflow due to the checks that preceeds it [Line 155](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-frankencoin/blob/main/contracts/ERC20.sol#L155) so it should be marked as `unchecked`.

### 5- Input check statements should be placed at the start of the functions :

The check statements on the functions input values should be placed at the beginning of the functions to avoid stack too deep errors and save gas.
